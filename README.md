# SnippingToolAdvance
A more advanced version of Windows Snipping Tool (in my eyes)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Features

<li>Copy to Clipboard</li>
<li>Save to File</li>
<li>Upload to Imgur</li>
<li>Convert to Text</li>

## To be done/finished

- [] Finish auto-delete Imgur links
- [] Add proper first-time setup
- [] Add editor to draw, add shapes & blur snips
- [] Code tidy-up

## Usage

Download the tool & compile. On first run SnippingToolAdvanced will create a directory in your Pictures folder & a settings.json
For usage with Imgur, you will need to specify an API Client-ID (https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient). Then right-click the SnippingToolAdvanced icon -> Settings and enter your Client-ID here
